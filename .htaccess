# The following rules are used by Pinegrap.

RewriteEngine on

# When the system is accessed from a sub-directory with an Apache alias
# (e.g. http://192.168.0.1/~example/), then you might need to uncomment the line
# below and update it to point to where the system is installed.  The system
# will attempt to automatically set the correct value for the line below during
# installation.  You might need to comment out the line below once you launch
# your site at a permanent URL without a sub-directory (e.g. http://www.example.com).

#RewriteBase /example/

# The following lines redirect all requests to the Pinegrap router,
# except for when an actual file or directory exists for the request.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
